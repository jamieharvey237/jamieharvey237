## Hi there, I'm JamieðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Manchester, keen to leverage my strong quantitative foundation to explore and solve complex problems in finance. My approach to learning is hands-on: I build interactive Python projects to reverse-engineer and understand the mechanics driving critical financial metrics and models. 

### ðŸ”­ What I'm Exploring

*   **Quantitative Finance:** Applying numerical methods to model financial markets and price assets.
*   **Algorithmic Trading:** Backtesting and analysing systematic strategies using historical data. 
*   **Risk Management:** Applying statistical methods to quantify portfolio risk and understand its impact on investors.

### ðŸ§  Tech Proficiency
* **Languages:** Python, MATLAB\n
* **Python Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
* **Tools:** LaTeX, Jupyter Notebook

Take a look at some of my pinned projects!
