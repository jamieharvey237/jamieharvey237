## Hi there, I'm Jamie👋

I'm a third-year Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Manchester, keen to leverage my strong quantitative foundation to explore and solve complex real-world problems. My approach to learning is hands-on: I build interactive Python projects to further both my coding ability and understanding of real-world mechanisms. 

### 🔭 Areas of Interests

* **Quantitative Finance:** Applying numerical methods to model financial markets, seeking to understand the drivers of critical financial metrics and models.
* **Algorithmic Trading:** Backtesting and analysing systematic strategies using historical data.
* **Machine Learning:** Building neural network algorithms to improve simulation efficiency against time-consuming direct numerical simulations in Combustion Chemistry. 

### 🧠 Tech Proficiency

* **Languages:** Python, MATLAB, SQL
* **Python Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
* **Tools:** LaTeX, Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

Take a look at some of my pinned projects!
